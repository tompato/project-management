# Project Management App
A project management application that has it's own back-end written in Node and Express
using GraphQL and Mongoose and a front-end written in React with Apollo. It allows the
user to add, edit and delete clients and projects, with a relationship between projects
and clients. It utilises the React router for managing a couple of routes and styling
is just using the basics of Bootstrap.
